# bouncyBall readme

The BouncyBall (RollyBally) game was made by me 2 years before I graduated from high school in Bulgaria.<br><br>

The code of the game has been created so that the product involves camera movement, character movement, obstacles that are progressively becoming more difficult to go around, and a scoring system that allows you to set high scores.<br><br>

Unfortunately, I am not a high school student anymore and I've lost the files to the C# code and Unity project. I just have backed up the first build version of the game.
